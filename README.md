# CorranEveryone's Skripts
This is where I share my Skripts that are made for Skript. Feel free to add them to your server and use them to make your own. Go ahead and modify them too.

## What is a Skript?
I made Skripts for [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) which allows for easy to read and make code for people who don't want to learn Java. This has another up side that you don't have to restart the server to test your code, you can just reload the skript and it will apply the changes instantly without having to kick everyone and wait for the server to get back up. 

## How much can a Skript do?
A Skript can do a lot, but there are limitation, but this is where Add-ons come in. My favorite is [SkBee](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee) as it adds a lot of functionallity Skript doesn't already have. You can even find a whole bunch more on [Skript Hub](https://skripthub.net/) along with Documentation, Examples, and Tutorials.

## What Skripts do I have here?
I have a few, but the ones you can find in this Repository are...
### Shared Health
Share a health bar with everyone on the server. This Skript is however still a work in progress and lacks lots of features but is functional.
